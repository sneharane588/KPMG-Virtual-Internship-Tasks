## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

#### Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

1. Customer Demographic 
2. Customer Addresses
3. Transactions data in the past 3 months
You decide to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltdâ€™s data.


## Task 2 : Data Insights
#### Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

Client has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation.

The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take.
