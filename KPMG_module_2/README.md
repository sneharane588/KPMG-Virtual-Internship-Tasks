# Task 2 : Data Insights

## Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes.
However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing.
Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, 
recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. 

The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities
i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take.
